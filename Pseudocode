	update relevantConditions with female values

#gather symptoms
display body diagram appropriate to gender
allow user to choose section experiencing symptom
create empty list patientSymptoms #use to track all symptoms
create variable symptomAccuracy #use to track accuracy
display list of symptoms related to chosen body section
display initial symptom-to-cause accuracy percentage bar # 0%

while user wants to add symptoms: 
	allow user to choose symptom
	if user chooses a symptom: 
		append symptom to patientSymptoms
		#calculate likelihood bar
		update symptomAccuracy if symptom matches cause
		calculate new accuracy percentage
		display updated accuracy percentage bar
		ask if user wants to add more symptoms
end while

#present results
function presentResults
create empty list possibleCauses
for each condition in relevantConditions:
	if condition has >= two symptoms matching with patientSymptoms:
	 	append condition to possibleCauses
		display results from possibleCauses in order
		display likelihood bar of accuracy percentage
end
